/**
 * Minimal, dependency-free test runner for
 * scripts/lib/feature-scenario-mapping.ts's deriveScenarioFeatures().
 *
 * No test framework exists yet in this repo (no jest/vitest/mocha in
 * package.json), and adding one just for this one helper would be
 * disproportionate. This script asserts against Node's built-in
 * `node:assert/strict`, exits non-zero on the first failure, and prints
 * "OK" on success - reproducible via `tsx scripts/test-feature-scenario-mapping.ts`,
 * no new dependency.
 *
 * Exercises the REAL V1.3 process + Features files (not a hand-built
 * fixture) so these tests fail immediately if the actual
 * shared_node_bindings in business/features/repair-management-features-v1.3.yaml
 * ever drift from the semantics they're supposed to encode - each
 * scenario below is a small synthetic PROCESS_EDGE-only Scenario, not the
 * full HP-REP-001.
